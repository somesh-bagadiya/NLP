Born in Bourges, France, on January 14, 1841, Morisot grew up in a cultured family that encouraged her artistic pursuits. Despite the constraints faced by women in the arts during the nineteenth century, she pursued her passion with determination, joining the ranks of the groundbreaking Impressionists, a group that sought to break away from the traditional approach to painting that was represented by the Salon de Paris.  Berthe Marie Pauline Morisot (January 14, 1841); http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/morisot/, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons Her work was regularly exhibited with her fellow Impressionists; a circle of Parisian painters that included iconic figures like Monet and Renoir. Morisot distinguished herself not only by her gender in the male-dominated art world but also by the delicate renderings of domestic life and intimate portraits in her oeuvre.  Marrying Eugène Manet, the brother of renowned painter Édouard Manet, she became an integral part of the artistic avant-garde of her time.   Originally under the tutelage of Joseph Guichard, Berthe and her sister Edma received early artistic training, which was unusual for women of their social standing. They were introduced to the Louvre, where they practiced copying masterworks. This exposure laid the foundation for Morisot’s future work. By 1862, she started studying under Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, a pivotal figure in landscape painting who notably influenced her style and steered her towards plein-air painting—a hallmark of Impressionism.

Her refusal to conform to traditional expectations created pathways for other female artists of the time. She met Édouard Manet in 1868, who deeply influenced her work, and the two developed a profound professional relationship. Morisot’s work evolved under Manet’s impact, exemplifying the Impressionist focus on light, shadow, and the essence of modern life.   During Morisot’s late period, her style culminated in a mature reflection of her life’s experiences. Despite not being formally recognized by the Académie des Beaux-Arts due to gender biases of the time, Morisot’s late works stood as a testament to her resilience and impact on the art world. Her canvases from this time embody the essence of Impressionism, with swift brushstrokes and a luminous palette.

With unwavering commitment, she gained acceptance to the Salon in 1864. Her art, characterized by its delicate brushwork and subtle interplay of light, was exhibited at the Salon until 1874. The Salon was the official, annual exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts and was crucial for artists seeking public recognition and critical acclaim.

Morisot married Manet’s brother, Eugène, further solidifying her position in their circle. She exhibited her work in the first Impressionist Exhibition in 1874 and would continue to be a central figure in this avant-garde movement, exhibiting with them regularly alongside Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Mary Cassatt, Camille Pissarro, and Marie Bracquemond. Morisot was not just a participant but an integral part of the movement’s struggle for recognition.   True to the ethos of the Impressionists, Morisot developed her signature style that embraced en plein air painting, a technique involving painting outdoors to capture the transient effects of light and color. Her brushwork grew looser and more confident, infusing her subjects with a sense of life and immediacy. She explored various media with dexterity, but it was her oil paintings and watercolors that solidified her status.

Her work, The Cradle (1872), where she lovingly portrays a mother gazing at her sleeping child, underscores the intimate theme of motherhood. The Sisters (1869) highlights the comfort of familial bonds.   With a strong emphasis on feminine grace, Morisot challenged gender expectations through her subject matter. Reading (1873) and Woman at Her Toilette (1875 – 1880) are prime examples that underscore her commitment to representing real women’s lives. Notably, her depictions often shied away from idealization, presenting her subjects with an authentic human presence that acknowledged the multi-faceted experiences of women of her time.
